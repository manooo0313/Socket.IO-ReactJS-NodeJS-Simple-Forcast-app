This is a simple example app for using Socket.IO, ReactJS and NodeJS followed https://www.valentinog.com/blog/socket-react tutorial

I want to say thank you  to Valention Gagliardi to publish this totorial!

How to use: 

First you need to get your own SECRET API KEY by sign up on https://darksky.net/dev
and of course you need to have node installed (https://nodejs.org/en/)


1: Make a project folder
2: Clone repository into the project folder
3: cd to 'backEnd' folder and install packages: npm i
4: open text editor and paste your own SECRET API KEY (what you just got on darksky) instead of this placeholder =>   PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
5: npm start
6: open another terminal and cd into the 'frontEnd' folder and install packages: npm i
7: npm start here  too
